       "array(['The short version:||||Overrated, poorly managed, the staff are rude and it isn\\'t worth the queues. If you want to enjoy your visit, you’ll have to pay $47 each for an express pass, if you think it’s worth it. Don’t bother with the $23 ticket because by the time you get there you’ll be too tired and annoyed to take any pleasure from the view. The views are amazing, that is undisputed. But that\\'s about all this place has going for it, and there are plenty of other places to go for a stunning view of New York City. Try Top of the Rock instead.||||||And now the long version - I\\'ll walk you through our experience:||||8.25pm: Arrive, cheerful and hoping for grand finale to our awesome weekend in NYC. Had great experience at Top of the Rock earlier in the day and want to see NYC skyline by night. Prepared for a long queue, although think that as it\\'s getting late, a lot of the families and tour groups will have visited during the day, and it\\'ll be comparatively quiet.||||8.30pm: Join line. Realise we were wrong about it being quiet - perhaps because there had been a lot of low cloud that weekend and everybody had put off their visit until the mist had cleared on Sunday. Informed by staff that wait is 90 minutes for non-ticket holders and 45 minutes for pre-booked ticket/NY pass holders. Then informed that we can purchase an express pass for $47 each and skip all the lines. An extra $24 each to bypass a 90 minute queue - a quick bit of maths and that makes my time worth $16 an hour. Still in good spirits, joke that \"I don\\'t get paid that much!\" and decide that 90 minutes isn\\'t too long to wait (although slightly annoyed with ourselves for not pre-booking and saving 45 minutes).||||8.40pm: Realise that what I think is nearly the end of the line is actually just a security checkpoint. ||||9.05pm: Pass through security checkpoint, still in a fairly good mood, encouraged by how quickly the line is moving. Join next line, to purchase tickets.||||9.15pm: Without explanation, all cashiers selling tickets switch off their lights, stop serving, count their cash and twiddle their thumbs. Think to ourselves that this is probably a security procedure or a technical fault.||||9.16pm: Am slightly concerned by pregnant woman in front of us who looks like she is about to keel over.||||9.17pm: Cashier serves a customer who is buying an express pass. Obviously not a technical fault then. We realise that this must just be crowd control, to stop too many people cramming into the next section. That\\'s fine, it doesn\\'t really make any difference where we\\'re standing; we can see the next line getting shorter because nobody is joining... but how difficult would it be to communicate that to us? Instead, cashier barks \"You have to wait, ma\\'am!\" at the puzzled customer at the front of the line who approaches the desk. Infuriating.||||9.20pm: Pregnant woman ducks out of the queue and sits on the floor (complete absence of any seating up until this point) whilst her partner remains in the line.||||9.24pm: Cashiers start serving again.||||9.26pm: Make decision not to go all the way to the top for an extra $17. Believe (incorrectly) that we must be over halfway there so don’t opt for express pass either. Purchase tickets. Feel slightly better about not pre-booking, as it would only have saved us 20 minutes. No backing out now, they have a no refund policy.||||9.27pm: Join next line. Looks twice as long as pre-security line, and also twice as wide. Wonder about 90-minute estimate - this queue looks longer than half an hour.||||9.40pm: For the tenth time, read fascinating facts about how much the ESB has reduced its CO2 emissions. If every building in every city in the world reduced their CO2 emissions by the same amount, it would be like taking 10 million bajillion cars off the road and the planet would be saved! Simple! Why can\\'t everywhere just cough up for expensive energy saving systems? Then they\\'d be as great as the Empire State Building!||||10.00pm: Along with several other people, pregnant woman has ducked out of queue to sit down again. She looks close to tears.||||10.15pm: End of the line is in sight; temporarily forget about pain in feet.||||10.17pm: Get badgered by shouty man selling map ($10) or iView app ($10). He seems to be suggesting that we are all complete idiots and clearly have no idea what we\\'ll be looking at. We\\'ll be able to see over 200,000 buildings and without the iView we won\\'t be able to identify all of them, only the iconic ones that we came to see! God forbid that you go up there just to appreciate the views. Luckily we picked up a sky map for $2 from Top-of-the-Rock earlier. Resist temptation to wave it in his face.||||10.20pm: It looks like we\\'ve reached the end of the line! They\\'re counting people through in groups now, so that must mean it\\'s only a short wait for the lifts! We walk past what looks like a restaurant, which may possibly have offered a place to sit for a while if it wasn\\'t closed.||||10.21pm: Turn corner. Lifts? No. Just a corridor. Stand in line. Realise that 90-minute estimate was a made up number plucked out of thin air. Remember pain in feet.||||10.25pm: Turn next corner. Lifts? No.||||10.30pm: Pose for photo which they will try to charge us $30 for at the other end. Resist temptation to punch the photographer, who cannot seem to comprehend why nobody wants to smile after standing for 2 hours and makes some wise crack to that effect, in between shouting \"Say Cheeeeeeeeese!\" in the most irritating, high pitched voice he can manage.||||10.40pm: Turn next corner. Lifts? Not quite. Two members of staff walk past, presumably going for their breaks. One declares that he is \"going for a sit down\" - a luxury that nobody still in the line has been afforded. The other is the photographer, who is inexplicably still repeating \"Say Cheeeeeeeese!\" People are obviously annoyed. Resist urge to stand there and scream.||||10.45pm: Turn next corner. Lifts? Yes!||||10.50pm: We\\'ve made it! Squash into the lift with 18 other people. \"This lift will take you up to the 80th floor! Have a great time!\" says attendant (possibly the only member of staff who was anything resembling polite). Realise that the observation platform is on the 86th floor. Realise that this means there will be another queue for a second set of lifts from the 80th floor. Resist temptation to collapse to my knees and scream \"Noooooooo!\" (but only because there isn\\'t room in the lift). ||||10.53pm: Take opportunity to use toilets before getting into another queue. Also an opportunity to sit down, as we still haven\\'t seen a single seat. Presumably this is why there is a member of staff in the toilets doing absolutely nothing - to move people along who are using the \\'restrooms\\' to actually rest their feet. Take a moment to ponder why every public toilet in the USA appears to have been constructed with a 3/4 inch gap either side of the door. Wonder if it is deliberate. Hope nobody is peering through.||||10.55pm: Walk past movie posters, King Kong etc. I have zero interest by this point. Join next queue. ||||11.00pm: Notice the windows. It might make it more bearable if we had a sneak preview of the view, as a reminder of why we came up here in the first place. The windows are frosted. Of course.||||11.10pm: Everybody clearly tired and fed up. Feet are throbbing. Member of staff (rudely) tells people to stop leaning on walls, sitting on floor etc. ||||11.15pm: Finally make it to the lifts. Could have walked up the 6 flights of stairs in this time. $24 to bypass almost 3 hours of queues would value my time at just over $8 per hour – almost sounds worth it now. Squash into the lift and travel up the remaining 6 floors.||||11:16pm: Arrive at 86th floor observatory of the Empire State Building. We expect everyone to rush outside to take in the view. Instead, all anybody wants to do is sit down. For reasons I cannot comprehend, there is no seating. All around the walls, radiators and window ledges have spikes on to stop people leaning on them. People sit down on the floor. We join them.||||11.20pm: We head outside. It’s massively overcrowded. The views are great. We manage to elbow our way to the front and get a few photos, until we have had enough walking around (feet are still pounding from standing in the line). We head back inside and sit down. A member of staff tells everyone to stand up – I suppose it looks bad when people step out of the lift and the first thing they set eyes on is a sea of miserable faces, desperate for 5 minutes of relief after standing for hours.||||11.35pm: Time to leave. Except that we have to queue for the lift. It’s a short queue as a result of other people being sent down the stairs.||||11.40pm: Back on the 80th floor, we’re directed through the gift shop. The idea of spending more money here is laughable, even more so when there is a queue at the checkout. We join the back of the line for the second set of lifts.||||11.45pm: I toy with the idea of just sitting on the ground until they escort me out of the building. It might be quicker.||||11.55pm: We make it down to ground level. The people on the photo stand seem baffled that nobody even wants to see their souvenir photograph, let alone pay for it. We\\'ve missed our last subway train and have to pay $35 for a cab. The express pass looks even more worth it. Except that $47 to go to the top of a building isn\\'t worth it. And neither is 3 hours queueing.'],\n",

Buy your ticket before you travel - you can buy them online at www.esbnyc.com - this will save you a good hour as you wont have to queue in the building to buy your ticket.||2. Early morning - try and make it an early port of call as the queues for the lift can be very long if you go around lunch time.||3. Night viewing - If you dont fancy an early morning visit. go up later on at night - its open till after 11 and the view of the city at night is something else!||4. Take gloves - especially if its not summer as it can be very windy and cold up there||All in all - this is probably one of the most famous landmakrs in the city and its worht the trip up to the 86th floor to take in the sprawling mass of skyscrapers and look down to see little yellow dots as the taxis go about their business.||I have been to NY twice and each time I went to visit the ESB twice - once in daylight and once at night time. Personally I think the night time is more magical but its great any time - unless its snowing in which case it can be like standing in a freezer up there.||If you dont buy your tickets online, you can of course buy them on the day but this can involve a lengthy queue in the basement so I would suggest buying them online.||Once you have your ticket, you can head up to another level where you queue for the lift and security check - bags are X-Rayed and you must pass through a metal detector.||Once cleared, you go into a lift that takes you up to I think the 82nd floor where you have the \"photo\" opportunity where you can get fleeced if you like :-)||After that, you go up in another lift to the 86th floor where you will find the gift shop and observatory. The shop is well stocked and has plenty to choose from - you can also rent audion tours to take up with you.||The views on a clear day you can see all the financial district, liberty, central park and pretty much everything in between.||It is a must do if your in NYC and I would be back there in a flash|'],\n",
